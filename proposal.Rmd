A brief plan for an exploratory analysis: What questions can be answered from the dataset?    

-What were the most common weather conditions during accidents?    
-Does the size of a city affect traffic accident rate during rush hour times?    
-What states have the most severe accidents?    
-How do different seasons affect crash rates among states?    
-How do the most populated cities (Des Moines, Cedar Rapids, Davenport) in Iowa compare in traffic accident rate?    
-Which year had the highest amount of accidents and did weather conditions affect those statistics?   
-Is there a difference between night and day in the rate of accidents and total accidents?    
-Does the size of the city affect the severity of the traffic delays?
